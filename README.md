# TDSR_python

Python port of successor representation (SR) code written for [Gardner, Schoenbaum, and Gershman 2018](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.1645). 

The original Matlab repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mphgardner/TDSR). 

To run the SR model on the available experiments, simply run `sim_TDSR.py <experiment_name>`. For the TD(0) model, run `sim_TDRL <experiment_name>`.
